# Chapter View Tracking API

## Overview
This system implements chapter-based view tracking with the following rules:
- 1 view per user per chapter allowed every 24 hours
- Views are account-based (not IP-based)
- Novel's total views = Sum of all unique chapter views
- Each chapter maintains its own view counter
- 24-hour cooldown period to prevent spam

## Models

### ChapterView Model
```javascript
{
    user: ObjectId (ref: User),
    chapter: ObjectId (ref: Chapter),
    novel: ObjectId (ref: Novel),
    viewedAt: Date,
    ipAddress: String,
    userAgent: String
}
```

### Updated Chapter Model
```javascript
{
    // existing fields...
    viewCount: Number (default: 0)
}
```

### Updated Novel Model
```javascript
{
    // existing fields...
    totalViews: Number (default: 0)
}
```

## How It Works

### View Recording Flow
1. User opens a chapter â†’ Frontend calls `POST /api/novel/view/chapter/:chapterId`
2. System checks if user has viewed this chapter in the last 24 hours
3. If no recent view exists:
   - Creates new ChapterView record
   - Increments chapter's `viewCount` by 1
   - Increments novel's `totalViews` by 1
   - Returns success with updated counts
4. If recent view exists:
   - Returns "already viewed" response
   - No counters are incremented

### View Counting Logic
- **Chapter Views**: Each chapter tracks its own view count
- **Novel Views**: Sum of all chapter view counts for that novel
- **24-Hour Rule**: Same user cannot generate multiple views for the same chapter within 24 hours
- **Automatic Sync**: When a chapter gets a view, the novel's total automatically increases

### Example Scenario
User reads a 10-chapter novel over 3 days:

**Day 1:** Reads chapters 1-3
- Chapter 1: +1 view
- Chapter 2: +1 view  
- Chapter 3: +1 view
- Novel total: +3 views

**Day 2:** Reads chapters 4-6, re-opens chapter 2
- Chapter 4: +1 view
- Chapter 5: +1 view
- Chapter 6: +1 view
- Chapter 2: No new view (24-hour cooldown)
- Novel total: +3 more views (total: 6)

**Day 3:** Finishes chapters 7-10
- Chapters 7-10: +4 views each
- Novel total: +4 more views (total: 10)

## Frontend Integration

### Recording Views
```javascript
// Call when user opens/starts reading a chapter
const recordView = async (chapterId) => {
    try {
        const response = await fetch(`/api/novel/view/chapter/${chapterId}`, {
            method: 'POST',
            headers: {
                'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
                'Content-Type': 'application/json'
            }
        });
        
        const result = await response.json();
        
        if (result.success) {
            console.log('View recorded:', result.data);
            // Update UI with new view counts
        } else if (result.alreadyViewed) {
            console.log('Already viewed within 24h');
            // Don't show view increment animation
        }
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error recording view:', error);
    }
};
```

### Getting Statistics
```javascript
// Get novel statistics for display
const getNovelStats = async (novelId) => {
    try {
        const response = await fetch(`/api/novel/view/novel/${novelId}/stats?timeframe=7d`);
        const result = await response.json();
        
        if (result.success) {
            const { totalViews, chapters } = result.data;
            // Display statistics in UI
        }
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error fetching stats:', error);
    }
};
```

## Database Considerations

### Indexes
- `{ user: 1, chapter: 1 }` - For checking 24-hour cooldown
- `{ chapter: 1, viewedAt: -1 }` - For chapter statistics
- `{ novel: 1, viewedAt: -1 }` - For novel statistics
- `{ viewedAt: 1 }` - For general queries and cleanup

### Data Retention
Consider implementing data cleanup for old view records if storage becomes an issue:

```javascript
// Optional: Cleanup views older than 1 year
db.chapterviews.deleteMany({
    viewedAt: { $lt: new Date(Date.now() - 365 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000) }
});
```

The `viewCount` and `totalViews` fields in Chapter and Novel models will persist the counts even after cleaning up old view records.
